Sociologists ask questions about why things are the way they are and how they could be different. They study things like culture, race, gender, social class, and power.\n\nFor example, sociologists might study why some people are rich and others are poor, how different cultures celebrate holidays, or why some people are treated differently because of their skin color. They use different methods like surveys, interviews, and observations to gather information and analyze it.\n\nSociology is important because it helps us understand our world and the people in it. It can help us solve problems and make positive changes in society. It also teaches us to be more aware of our own biases and assumptions, and to see things from other people's perspectives."
