      "long": "Maths is a subject that helps us understand numbers, shapes, patterns and how they all work together. We use maths to solve problems, count things, measure things and even to understand time. \n\nFor example, if you want to know how many apples you have, you can use maths to count them. You can also use maths to share your apples with your friends equally. Maths can help us understand how much time we have left to play, or how long it will take to finish our homework.\n\nWe can use maths to figure out how much money we have or how much we need to save to buy something we want. We can also use maths to understand how much space we need to build a house or how much paint we need to paint a room. \n\nMaths is a very important subject that helps us in our everyday life. It teaches us to think logically and to solve problems in a systematic way. So, if you love puzzles and problem-solving, then maths is definitely the subject for you!"
